I'm Flyingsky, a very curious person!  
I'm not afraid of learning something new or failing on the way of doing so.  
Quite the opposite, it excites me when I finally figure out how to do something difficult.  
My interest mostly lies in binary reverse engineering, but I like challenging myself and trying something new. 

I wrote a (german) [whitepaper](https://github.com/Byebyesky/IT-Security-Projekt/raw/master/Dokumente/Whitepaper_Projekt_IT-Sicherheit_Kolz_und_Klein.pdf) and [proof of concept exploits](https://github.com/Byebyesky/IT-Security-Projekt/tree/master/POC) for a few wordpress vulnerabilities for an IT-Security class in university, which also included a [30-minute long presentation](https://github.com/Byebyesky/IT-Security-Projekt/raw/master/Dokumente/Presentation.pdf).  
I've also worked on a Japanese to English [translation](https://gbatemp.net/threads/maplestory-3ds-the-girl-of-destiny-100-eng-patch-release.430440/) of a game called Maple Story 3DS with others.  
My tasks were reverse engineering and translating.   
Another piece of Software I wrote is [streaming for the 3DS](https://github.com/Byebyesky/Luma3DS-Streaming-Fork). It allows you to wirelessly project your 3DS screen to your PC for recording purposes.


My skillset includes:
* Binary Reverse Engineering  
* In-depth Linux knowledge  
* Experience with Python, C and C++  
* Experience with embedded systems  
* Electronics knowledge  
* Fluency in English and German  
* Advanced level in Japanese
