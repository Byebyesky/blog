If you're on gbatemp you've already seen these screens:

![Help Screen 1](/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/maple/translatingTheFirstLines/helpScreenTL.png)
![Help Screen 2](/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/maple/translatingTheFirstLines/helpScreenTL2.png)

But I tried to translate it a little further, and came up with [this](https://imgur.com/a/vmE5c).

Also what I thought was funny:

![Wrong translation](/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/maple/translatingTheFirstLines/s_button_load_jp.png)

the person, which started with the translation, translated 読み込む as "Read", it's better to call it load, because as far as I know you load a save file. And I think in computer terminology it almost always means "to load". And the writing moves when you select the button and unselect it (the writing on the yellow button is a little bit further on the left). But no hate there, I'm almost certain that I'm gonna make some mistakes and I can't even do images myself. :D

Also i have to say, it's challenging to come up with a translation that is understandable but not too big for the textbox.

I think this will be the last post for this week, because of my exam. I'm gonna work as hard as I can on this project, after I finished my exam.
Thank you for reading and stay tuned.
